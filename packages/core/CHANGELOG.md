# @lit-pigeon/core

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- fc043b1: Put the `types` condition first in `exports` — per the Node/TypeScript
  resolution spec it must precede `import`/`require`, otherwise it can never
  match. Types still resolved via the top-level `types` fallback, but this
  removes the bundler warning and makes conditional type resolution correct.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 697fc07: Packaging hygiene: every package now ships a `LICENSE` file and a `README` in
  its npm tarball (10 packages previously had no README on the registry), and
  declares `homepage`, `bugs`, `author`, and `keywords`. No API changes. Also
  corrects a stale repo link in the Svelte package README.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d2cbd91: Stock image integration in the asset manager. A new **Stock** tab searches Unsplash and Pexels directly (the host supplies API keys via `AssetManagerConfig.stock`) and inserts a photo by its hotlinked URL, with in-picker photographer/provider attribution and the required Unsplash download-ping. The stock UI and provider code are lazy-loaded, so they add nothing to the core editor bundle.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a44ddbb: Custom font management. Register web fonts via `fontConfig`: the editor's font picker lists configured and brand fonts, the preview and export load them, and the MJML renderer emits `<mj-font>` for each registered font. `@lit-pigeon/core` adds the `FontDefinition` type and `fontConfig` / `RenderOptions.fonts`.
- a44ddbb: Saved / reusable rows (user content library). Save a row to a personal library from the row toolbar and re-insert it from the new Saved palette tab by dragging it onto the canvas. `@lit-pigeon/core` gains the row-library types, an in-memory storage implementation, and a clone helper; `@lit-pigeon/mcp-server` gains a file-system-backed `FsRowLibraryStorage`.
- a44ddbb: Special link types. Insert unsubscribe, view-in-browser, and custom system links via a link-type picker available in both the button property panel and the rich-text link editor. `@lit-pigeon/core` adds `LinkType`, `SYSTEM_LINK_TYPES`, and `EditorConfig.linkTypes`; the sanitizers now allow `tel:` and `{{…}}` template hrefs.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Verify the automated CI publishing pipeline: this patch release is published
  by the Release workflow using the LIT_PIGEON_NPM_TOKEN secret with npm
  provenance, confirming end-to-end automation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish all packages at 0.1.1.

  The initial 0.1.0 release was left unusable: five packages (core, editor,
  angular, parser-mjml, renderer-mjml) were published and then unpublished —
  permanently burning the 0.1.0 version number — which broke the other nine
  packages that depend on `@lit-pigeon/core`. This release republishes all
  packages at a clean, fully-installable 0.1.1 and switches internal
  dependencies to `workspace:^` so they publish as caret ranges.
