# @lit-pigeon/editor

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- af5896c: Fix the TS2322 strictFunctionTypes error in the FontSize TipTap extension: the `renderHTML` callback parameter is now contextually typed by TipTap's `Attribute` interface instead of an over-narrow explicit annotation. The package now passes `tsc --noEmit` with zero errors.
- ccb858f: Properties-panel polish: replace the box-model diamond spacing editor with a compact Figma-style segmented row (T/R/B/L), render schema-driven checkbox fields as toggle switches, hoist the toggle-switch and secondary-button styles into the shared panel stylesheet (deduped from button/row panels), and style the image Upload button to match the input chrome.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish all packages at 0.1.1.

  The initial 0.1.0 release was left unusable: five packages (core, editor,
  angular, parser-mjml, renderer-mjml) were published and then unpublished —
  permanently burning the 0.1.0 version number — which broke the other nine
  packages that depend on `@lit-pigeon/core`. This release republishes all
  packages at a clean, fully-installable 0.1.1 and switches internal
  dependencies to `workspace:^` so they publish as caret ranges.

  - @lit-pigeon/core@0.1.1
